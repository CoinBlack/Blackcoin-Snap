summary: proof of stake decentralized digital currency
description: |
  Blackcoin is a decentralised digital currency with near-instant transaction
  speeds and negligible transaction fees built upon Proof of Stake 3.0 (PoSV3, BPoS)
  as introduced by the Blackcoin development team.

  Blackcoin More is the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.
  It takes Blackcoin to the next level by building upon Bitcoin Core 0.13.2 with some patches
  from newer Bitcoin Core versions to offer performance enhancements, wider compatibility
  with third party services and a more advanced base.

  For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of the Blackcoin More
  software, see https://blackcoinmore.org
